# NOTATIONS: 
# Please don't name any fields ending with 'vec' 
# [MC]...   may change due to some other settings in the same setup 
# [KF]...   keep fixed for now because only there is only 1 available option 
# ...[%%]   units 
# [def:..]  default options 

# PATH AND FILE RELATED CONFIGURATIONS
# data_path: for storage, will create "raw" and "processed" foldera
# file_pref: file prefix for the data 
file_pref: sweep_me_now

# SIMULATION TIME RELATED VARIABLES 
# tstop:    stop time, assumed run from 0ms. [ms]
# dt:       time step [ms]

# SINGLE-NEURON RELATED VARIABLES 
# num:      [MC] total number of neurons in the network
# E_type:   [KF] excitatory type (currently only PYR)
# I_type:   [KF] inhibitory type (currently on PV)

# SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION RELATED VARIABLES 
# Either of these options:
# 1. Rectangular 2D  
# type: rect
# size: [NUM_NEURON_IN_XAXIS, NUM_NEURON_IN_Y_AXIS]
# 2. Spherical Fibonnaci lattice 3D 
# type: sphere
# norm: how to normalize the distance between points
#       arc:  normalize by smallest arc length on the sphere surface
#       eucl: by the smallest euclidean distance 
# 3. Lattice 2D
# type: lattice 
# lattice_template: a matrix of n_neuron_in_template x 2 (which is 
#                   basically x and y coordinate)
# index_template:   a column vector of n_neuron_in_template signifying
#                   if a neuron is excitatory (+1) or inhibitory (-1)
# lattice_distance: distance between the templates 
# NOTE: have not tested for user lattice 
#       so just use the default option for now, 
#       which is a template of 4E surround 1I neurons 
space:
